  <h2>I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. My major is Digital Narrative and Interactive design, which is a joint program between the School of Computing and Information and the English Department at the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. Initially, I planned on majoring in Computer Science, but for a couple of reasons I decided to switch to a CS minor, and shift my focus to DNID.</h2>

 <h1>Field of Study</h1>
  <h2>I initially went to community college at CCAC, and got an Associate's Degree in Computer Science, then later enrolled at Pitt and transferred some of my credits. Unfortunately, less of my classes than I'd hoped actually transferred, and the CS major at Pitt would require me to take many very difficult classes at the same time. More fortunately, they had just introduced the DNID program, which was more in line with my interests anyway. Initially I planned on doing a double major, but I ultimately decided against it.</h2>
